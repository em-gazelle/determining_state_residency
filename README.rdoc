Got wanderlust? Want to do your taxes right? Want to see if you can take that extended vacation without losing residency?

This app will help you determine your official state of residency (for tax purposes; we can't tell you where your soul belongs) as well as help you to achieve your desired state of residency by calculating the minimum number of days you must spend in your desired state of residency, as well as how many vacation days you can take elsewhere.
